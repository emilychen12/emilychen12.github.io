                <p id="about-paragraph"> 
                    I am a recent graduate of Cornell University with a master's degree in computer science and bachelor's degrees in English and information science 
                    with minors in education and computer science. Throughout my time in college, I have been told that these are an interesting combination of subjects; however, I believe in the marriage of these 
                    fields of study. Thus, I think my foremost interest is in digital storytelling. While I love reading, some of the best stories I have often encountered come from video games. It is fair to say, in my case, that 
                    I often remember the stories from these video games and their impact on my thinking more than some books that I have read. I can recount numerous times where I spent days reflecting on a game's story regardless 
                    of the game's length or popularity. As an avid gamer and a creative writer, I hope to create video games that can instill this type of impact. Games can be a form of literature, and I hope that 
                    I can delve deeper into the art of video game writing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regarding my academic interests, in the field of computer science, I am interested in game development and natural language processing. 
                    In the English field, my primary interests are 20th Century American and British Literature, American theatre, cultural studies, and secondary education in English.
                    Lastly, my foremost interest is in improving public education and access to educational resources through ethnographic research and understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, playing piano, reading and analyzing prose literature, and writing stories. Additionally, I have extensive experience as a piano accompanist 
                    and as a piano teacher. Regarding my accompaniment experience, I have accompanied numerous soloists and ensembles during concerts and auditions and was the piano accompanist for Cornell's theatre production of <i>Mr. Burns</i>.

                    <h3>Video Game Scripting and Web Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of my future goals is to become a professional video game writer. Ever since I was a child, I have been enamored by video games. When I was three years-old, I played my first game <em>Super Mario 64</em> and 
                        have never stopped gaming ever since. In particular, I enjoy playing Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs), which heavily depend on a captivating storyline. JRPGs have been one of the most impactful forms of art and literature 
                        that I have engaged with. When executed well, the stories and characters can make a lasting impact on the player.
                        As a creative writer, I would love to utilize my writing skills to create novel and unique games that can reach the hearts of new players. 
                        Children should not be prevented from having fun, and I believe that children can learn a great deal from video games as I have; thus, I hope that I can create video games that 
                        are both enjoyable and educational. Moreover, I want to make games that combat stereotypes and harmful norms as video games can greatly shape the ideologies of the 
                        players. Countless popular games today exclusively feature white male heroes, sexualized and/or helpless women, and heterosexual relationships. The perpetuation of these social norms and the lack of representation 
                        in these games often deter new players because they cannot relate to the protagonist or the story. To welcome players of all social identities, I hope that I can create games that are inclusive and diverse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, I hope that I can continue to fully employ my web development skills. Like many others, I find it frustrating to navigate and engage with websites with poor user interfaces and unclear affordances.
                        Therefore, it brings me great joy to create accessible websites and ensure great user experience. Creating websites can be time-consuming and expensive, so 
                        I would like to offer my services as a web developer to clients who need a website to promote their cause or business.

                    <h3>Education and Literature</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of my goals in the future is to become an educator in literature. My middle school and high school English teachers played an essential role in inciting my interest in reading 
                        and analyzing literature. Consequently, I would like to do the same by spreading my passion for literature to the future generation of students. Furthermore, I have met
                        many individuals who feel obligated to study STEM because of the stigma and belief that the humanities are insignificant and fruitless. However, literature, history, art and 
                        philosophy have played an integral part in shaping our society. Therefore, I want to be an individual who educates others on the importance and beauty of literature and the arts. 
                        I hope that more people will discover the joys of reading and writing and the impact literature has on the world. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More significantly, I believe that we can do much more in ensuring that all students, regardless of class, gender, sexual orientation, race or religion, can receive a quality education. 
                        Using culturally relevant teaching methods and theories of critical pedagogy, I believe that I can make a significant impact on the lives of youths who genuinely desire to learn. 
                    </p>
